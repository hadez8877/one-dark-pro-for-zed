# Previews
Here you can find all the previews of the 4 themes included in this extension, so you can see at a glance what your favorite themes will look like before applying them.

### One Dark Pro Darker
This theme, as its name suggests, is a bit darker than the default one (in case you're asking, it's my favorite ;D). It's perfect for resting your eyes and focusing more on your code.

### One Dark Pro Flat
This theme is lighter and has brighter colors, making it ideal if you struggle to find variables or functions in your code (like me).
