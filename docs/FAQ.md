## Which theme variant should I choose?

- One Dark Pro (Classic): Best for general use
- One Dark Pro Darker: Better for low-light environments
- One Dark Pro Flat: Good for high-contrast needs
- One Dark Pro Mix: Balanced hybrid approach
- One Dark Pro Night Flat: Best for night coding

## Can I customize the colors?
Currently, Zed doesn't support theme customization. You would need to modify the theme files directly.

## Does this affect performance?
No, the theme is lightweight and doesn't impact editor performance.

## Why can't I find the theme in Zed?
Make sure you:
1. Have the latest version of Zed
2. Are connected to the internet
3. Have properly installed the extension

## How do I update the theme?
Zed should automatically update extensions. You can also manually check for updates in the Extensions panel.

## Some syntax colors look different from VS Code
While we aim for consistency, some minor differences might exist due to Zed's theming system.

## The terminal colors look wrong
Make sure you're using a compatible terminal and that no other terminal themes are conflicting.
